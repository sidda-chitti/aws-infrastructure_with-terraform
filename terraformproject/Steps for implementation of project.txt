Steps for implementation of project

The task to create the infrastructure within aws cloud by using 
IAAC (infrastructure as a code) terraform tool

the automation of infrastructure contains of creating vpc, subnets, IGW, RT, S3, security group(sg)
two EC2 machines with webpages in subnets by using sg, and last providing the load balancing to them.

step1: create aws account and get credentials of secretkey and accesskey and install terraform in local

step2: create folder in local and open cli or vs code

step3: create provider.tf file to access the provider, and main.tf file to write the code for infrastructure creation
variables.tf -- to create variables in the code (optional)
variables.tfvars -- to give the actual values of the variables (optional)

step4: create a vpc(virtual private cloud) by following the syntax and requirements

step5: inside the vpc create 2 subnets either public or private

step6: provide an internet gateway to the subnets and provide route table with necessary 
       inbound and outbound rules for both subnets

step7: create security group for the vpc with ingress and egress

step8: create bucket with unique bucket name

step9: create basic html files of userdata1.sh and userdata2.sh to call in the creation servers 

step10: now create server1 by using vpc security group in subet1 also provide basic html file userdata1.sh
        like server1 create server2 with customed security group of vpc in subnet2 also provide the webpage userdata2.sh
step11: create an application load balancer with necessary target groups with http port

apply this process and execute the hcl code to create the aws infrastructure automation with terraform.
